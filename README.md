# apigenome
apigenome is a collection of libraries and command-line utilities for big data genomic analysis.

Currently, apigenome is UNDER CONSTRUCTION, so many utilities may not be fully documented. It may also
contain bugs. So use at your own risk.

List of urrently provided utilities:
* bed-diff              - Compare genotypes between different VCF/PLINK files
* draw-afs              - Draw allele frequency spectrum
* mift                  - Mendelian-inheritance filtering based on likelihoods
* run-make              - Run multiple jobs simultaneously and fault-tolerantly
* vcf-resolve-chrX-hets - Resolve chrX heterozygosity based on likelihoods
* vcf-summary           - Summarize SNPs in VCF files
* vcfast                - Fast analytic tools for processing VCF files (C++)
