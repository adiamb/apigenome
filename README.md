  draw-afs              - Draw allele frequency spectrum
  mift                  - Mendelian-inheritance filtering based on likelihoods
  run-make              - Run multiple jobs simultaneously and fault-tolerantly
  vcf-resolve-chrX-hets - Resolve chrX heterozygosity based on likelihoods
  vcf-summary           - Summarize SNPs in VCF files
  vcfast                - Fast analytic tools for processing VCF files (C++)
